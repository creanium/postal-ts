Welcome to Postal Server SDK for TypeScript! üéâ

This is a friendly and easy-to-use library for interfacing with the open source mail delivery platform, [Postal](https://postal.atech.media/). It's written in TypeScript, to provide type safety and autocompletion for a better developer experience. Our aim is to make sending emails as enjoyable and as painless as possible!

## Installation

You can easily install this SDK with **npm**:

```bash
npm install @widenex/postal-ts
```

Or with **yarn**:

```bash
yarn add @widenex/postal-ts
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to **send an email** ‚úâÔ∏è with this SDK:

```typescript
import { Client } from "@widenex/postal-ts";

const client = new Client("postal.your-domain.com", "your-server-key");

client
  .send({
    from: "contact@your-domain.com",
    subject: "Hello, Postal!",
    body: "This is a simple test email.",
    to: "someone@their-domain.com",
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(`Emails sent: ${result.size}`);
    console.log("Recipients:", result.recipients);
  });
```
