Welcome to Postal Server SDK for TypeScript! üéâ

This is a friendly and easy-to-use library for interfacing with the open source mail delivery platform, [Postal](https://postal.atech.media/). It's written in TypeScript, to provide type safety and autocompletion for a better developer experience. Our aim is to make sending emails as enjoyable and as painless as possible!

## Installation

You can easily install this SDK with **npm**:

```bash
npm install @widenex/postal-ts
```

Or with **yarn**:

```bash
yarn add @widenex/postal-ts
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to **send an email** ‚úâÔ∏è with this SDK:

```typescript
import { Client } from "@widenex/postal-ts";

const client = new Client("postal.your-domain.com", "your-server-key");

client.send({
    from: "contact@your-domain.com",
    to: "someone@their-domain.com",
    subject: "Hello, Postal!",
    body: "This is a simple test email.",
  });
```

You can also use an **html body** just with the *isHtml* label:

```typescript
client.send({
    ...
    body: "<h1>This is an awesome title</h1><p>Followed by a paragraph</p>",
    isHtml: true,
  })
```

Do you have **multiple recipients**? Just use an array:

```typescript
client.send({
    to: ["someone1@their-domain.com", "someone2@their-domain.com"],
    ...
  })
```


You can also add **cc**, **bcc**, **sender** and **replyTo** fields:

```typescript
client.send({
    cc: "cc@their-domain.com",
    bcc: "bcc@their-domain.com",
    sender: "i-am-the-sender@your-domain.com",
    replyTo: "reply-me@your-domain.com",
    ...
  })
```

You can also pass an array for **cc** and **bcc** fields:

```typescript
client.send({
    cc: ["cc1@their-domain.com", "cc2@their-domain.com"],
    bcc: ["bcc1@their-domain.com", "bcc2@their-domain.com"],
    ...
  })
```

The send method returns sent messages with their ids:

```typescript
const { id, messages } = await client.send(...);
```
